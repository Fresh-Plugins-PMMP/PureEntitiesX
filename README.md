# PureEntitiesX

This is a Fork of the original PureEntities, which went inactive about half a year back. RevivalPMMP is now maintaining it and updating it, so now you can have mobs on your server with this plugin! (At least until Pocketmine implements it)

> PureEntitiesX does not officially provide compatibility with _Third Party PocketMine_ server softwares.
>
> Compatibility can be found with some, but do not complain if it happens not to be.
>
> or ask @caspervanneck to fix. but i cant fix them all so just wait

## Contributing/Issues:

We are pretty relaxed about our issues. As long as they are descriptive, contain readable english, and are actualy a problem. For Pull Requests, please make sure that they are meaningful and that you _*TEST THEM FIRST,*_ before you PR to minimize time we have to spend debugging (If your PR is super buggy, we will close it/requests changes). Please use our Gitter for setup questions, feature requests, and anything that isn't an Issue. _*Please note that issues that don't comply with our rules will be closed*_ 

## Usage:

You are welcome to use actual data from PureEntitiesX (Mob Widths, Heights, Item Drops), but please don't copy our AI and claim it as your own. We give full credit to @milk0417 to starting the AI, but we have made numerous changes since then, so we ask you kindly _*Not to Copy our code*_

## Features:

-All mobs Implemented (Besides Bosses) From Pig to Magma Cubes, we've got them all! 

-Auto Spawning of Mobs around players. We don't have them spawn in each loaded chunk, just near players to maximize server performance

-Correct Mob drops. Creepers don't drop Redstone, last we checked, so we updated mobs drops with new items!

-More Configuration Coming Soon! We are adding a config with complete custimizability. Stay Tuned!


-and more coming soon

## How to Install

Download the Zip folder under the Releases tab for V#.0-beta and extract the Phar. Alternatively, you can download the scource code, or new development builds from Poggit.

It still has some bugs, but it is still very usable, and we will work to get them resolved ASAP. 

## Pocketmine Mob AI

Once Pocketmine comes out with a Mob AI, we plan to shift our focus to adding more customization to the Pocketmine Mob AI (Item Drop COntrol, Damage Control, Mob type Spawn control, etc.) Once Pocketmine Mob AI comes out, you can be confident that you can keep using PureEntitiesX!

## Plugin Help

Protect an Area from Mob Spawns:

The PureEntitiesX API allows you to disable/enable Mob spawning in certain areas. See and download our monster protection addon plugin over here: https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PEXProtection
