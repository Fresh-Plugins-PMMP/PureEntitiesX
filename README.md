This is a Fork of the original PureEntities plugin which has become inactive; RevivalPMMP is now updating and maintaining it, so  you can have smart mobs on your server! (At least until Pocketmine implements them)

PureEntitiesX does not officially provide compatibility with PocketMine-MP _Third Party_ builds.
Compatibility may be found with some, but do not expect anything.

## Contributing/Issues:

We are pretty relaxed about our issues. As long as they are descriptive and contain readable english, we may allow them to be referenced for bug fixes. For Pull Requests, please make sure that they actually fix or add something and that you ***test it*** before you PR. If the PR is buggy, we will request changes or close it. Please use our [Forums](http://revivalpmmpforums.gq) for setup questions, feature requests, and anything that isn't an Issue. ***Please note that issues that don't comply with our rules will be closed***

**When contributing and using PhpStorm - use the phpstorm_codeformatting.xml template which can be found in root directory!**

## Usage:

You are welcome to use actual data from PureEntitiesX (Mob Widths, Heights, Item Drops), but please don't copy our AI and claim it as your own. We give full credit to @milk0417 to starting the AI, but we have made numerous changes since then, so we ask you kindly _*Not to Copy our code (Unless you are forking and PR-ing, of course)*_

## Features:

- Mobs have proper AI and tracking
- Mobs naturally spawn within the proper areas
- Mobs now drop their proper items with their proper rates
- Server setting implimentations
- Others Coming soon!

## How to Install

Download the Zip folder under the Releases tab for V#.0-beta and extract the Phar. Alternatively, you can download the scource code, or new development builds from Poggit.

For More information on Poggit, see the Paragraph on it below.

## Pocketmine Mob AI

Once Pocketmine comes out with a Mob AI, we plan to shift our focus to adding more customization to the Pocketmine Mob AI (Item Drop COntrol, Damage Control, Mob type Spawn control, etc.) Once Pocketmine Mob AI comes out, you can be confident that you can keep using PureEntitiesX!

## Plugin Help

Protect an Area from Mob Spawns:

The PureEntitiesX API allows you to disable/enable Mob spawning in certain areas. See and download our monster protection addon plugin over here: https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PEXProtection

## Poggit

We use Poggit to share our Latest Builds! Keep in mind that they may not all be stable, so use our release build from https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PureEntitiesX if you want to stay stable! Feel free to also drop a review while you are there, because they help us know how you like the plugin.
